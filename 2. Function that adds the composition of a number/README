TASK:

getSumOfNumbers takes 2 parameters: number and type. The number parameter is the number by which the sum will be calculated. That is, if the number 10 was passed, then the function should calculate the sum from 0 to 10 (0 + 1 + 2 + ... + 10). The type parameter is responsible for selecting numbers for calculating the sum. It can be 3 values: “odd”, “even” and “”. If type is “odd”, then only odd numbers should be included in the sum, “even” - even numbers, empty string “” - all numbers. By default, the type parameter must be equal to odd.
