TASK:

Imagine that your friend is the owner of an amateur football club. Team players score a lot of goals and the club staff is tired of counting all the statistics every time after the match. Therefore, they decided to ask you as a web developer to help solve this problem. You need to optimize the task of counting statistics using the JavaScript programming language.

You have an array of goals, where each index represents the match played, and the number below the index represents the number of goals scored in that particular match.

Using this goals array, you need to display the following statistics for the entire season:
1. Most scoring game in terms of goals. Display in the modal window via alert the message "The most scoring match was at number ... ; .... goals were scored in it".
2. Worst games ever. There are several of them in the array, so you need to display the message “The most unsuccessful matches were under the numbers ... . In each of them, ... ball(s) were scored.”. Do not take into account games with automatic defeat.
3. Total number of goals for the season. Do not take into account games with automatic defeat.
4. Were there automatic defeats. If there were, then display a message via alert “There were automatic defeats: yes”, otherwise “There were automatic defeats: no”.
5. Average number of goals per match.
6. Sort the goals in ascending order and display all results separated by commas in the alert modal. The goals array must not be modified.
