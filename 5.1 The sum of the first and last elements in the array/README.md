TASK:

You need to create a getSumOfSequence function that takes one number parameter. This function should create an array of numbers from 0 to number. That is, if a number equal to 5 were passed, then the array should look like this: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Use a for loop to populate an array with elements.



The getSumOfSequence function must return the sum of the first and last elements of the resulting array.
