You need to create a new updatedPrices array that will contain the same numbers from the prices array, but only increased by 0.5.

After the price increase, you need to notify the customers of the coffee shop, so display a message for each type of coffee via alert “Coffee name is now worth price euro”, where name is the name of the coffee and price is the updated price of the coffee.
