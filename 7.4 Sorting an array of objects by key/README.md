Imagine that you are developing a voucher program for a local hospital. Previously, coupons were issued manually and you need to optimize this task.

You need to create a giveTalonsInOrder function that takes 2 parameters:

1. patients. An array of objects, each of which stores information about the patient's name and its unique id number.
2. orders. An array of unique id numbers that specifies the order in which patients should queue.

The function should return a new array in which the objects from the patients array will be sorted by id from the orders array.
