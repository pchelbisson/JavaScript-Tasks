TASK:

Imagine there is an investigation going on at the police station. Several crimes have been committed. The police have other higher priority tasks, so they asked you to write a program that will calculate the criminal from the data already known.

Your task is to create a getKiller function. getKiller takes 2 parameters:

1. suspectInfo. This is an object where the keys are the people suspected of the crime and the values are arrays of the people the suspects saw on the day of the murder.
2. deadPeople. This is an array with the names of the people the perpetrator killed.

The criminal is the one who saw all the people killed on the day of the murder. The getKiller function must return the name of the killer.
