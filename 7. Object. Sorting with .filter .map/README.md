TASK: 
You are given an array of users users. Each of them has a status property, which can be either "online" or "offline".

You need to create a new array onlineUsers that will contain objects of only those users whose status is "online".

Then display via alert the message “Now the following users are online: usersOnlineNames”, where usersOnlineNames is a string in which user names are displayed separated by commas.

For the code above, the result should be: “The following users are currently online: David, Bob”.
